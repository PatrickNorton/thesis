  abstract = {Any proof of P ≠ NP will have to overcome two barriers: relativization and natural proofs. Yet over the last decade, we have seen circuit lower bounds (e.g., that PP does not have linear-size circuits) that overcome both barriers simultaneously. So the question arises of whether there is a third barrier to progress on the central questions in complexity theory.In this article, we present such a barrier, which we call algebraic relativization or algebrization. The idea is that, when we relativize some complexity class inclusion, we should give the simulating machine access not only to an oracle A, but also to a low-degree extension of A over a finite field or ring.We systematically go through basic results and open problems in complexity theory to delineate the power of the new algebrization barrier. First, we show that all known nonrelativizing results based on arithmetization---both inclusions such as IP = PSPACE and MIP = NEXP, and separations such as MAEXP ⊄ P/poly---do indeed algebrize. Second, we show that almost all of the major open problems---including P versus NP, P versus RP, and NEXP versus P/poly---will require non-algebrizing techniques. In some cases, algebrization seems to explain exactly why progress stopped where it did: for example, why we have superlinear circuit lower bounds for PromiseMA but not for NP.Our second set of results follows from lower bounds in a new model of algebraic query complexity, which we introduce in this article and which is interesting in its own right. Some of our lower bounds use direct combinatorial and algebraic arguments, while others stem from a surprising connection between our model and communication complexity. Using this connection, we are also able to give an MA-protocol for the Inner Product function with O (√nlogn) communication (essentially matching a lower bound of Klauck), as well as a communication complexity conjecture whose truth would imply NL ≠ NP.},

Here I survey the status of this problem in 2016, for a broad audience of mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. I offer a personal perspective on what it's about, why it's important, why it's reasonable to conjecture that P ≠ NP is both true and provable, why proving it is so hard, the landscape of related problems, and crucially, what progress has been made in the last half-century toward solving those problems. The discussion of progress includes diagonalization and circuit lower bounds; the relativization, algebrization, and natural proofs barriers; and the recent works of Ryan Williams and Ketan Mulmuley, which (in different ways) hint at a duality between impossibility proofs and algorithms.},

  abstract = {Zero knowledge plays a central role in cryptography and complexity. The seminal work of Ben-Or et al. (STOC 1988) shows that zero knowledge can be achieved unconditionally for any language in NEXP, as long as one is willing to make a suitable physical assumption: if the provers are spatially isolated, then they can be assumed to be playing independent strategies.Quantum mechanics, however, tells us that this assumption is unrealistic, because spatially-isolated provers could share a quantum entangled state and realize a non-local correlated strategy. The MIP* model captures this setting.In this work, we study the following question: Does spatial isolation still suffice to unconditionally achieve zero knowledge even in the presence of quantum entanglement?We answer this question in the affirmative: we prove that every language in NEXP has a 2-prover zero knowledge interactive proof that is sound against entangled provers; that is, NEXP ⊆ ZK-MIP*.Our proof consists of constructing a zero knowledge interactive probabilistically checkable proof with a strong algebraic structure, and then lifting it to the MIP* model. This lifting relies on a new framework that builds on recent advances in low-degree testing against entangled strategies, and clearly separates classical and quantum tools.Our main technical contribution is the development of new algebraic techniques for obtaining unconditional zero knowledge; this includes a zero knowledge variant of the celebrated sumcheck protocol, a key building block in many probabilistic proof systems. A core component of our sumcheck protocol is a new algebraic commitment scheme, whose analysis relies on algebraic complexity theory.},

A nondeterministic L(n)-tape bounded Turing machine can be simulated by a deterministic [L(n)]2-tape bounded Turing machine, provided L(n)≥log2n. Computations of nondeterministic machines are shown to correspond to threadings of certain mazes. This correspondence is used to produce a specific set, namely the set of all codings of threadable mazes, such that, if there is any set which distinguishes nondeterministic tape complexity classes from deterministic tape complexity classes, then this is one such set.}
